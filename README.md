Customer Churn Prediction in B2B Context
Overview
Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction in B2B Context project! This repository is dedicated to tackling the pressing issue of customer churn within B2B environments. By predicting churn before it fully materializes, businesses can take proactive steps to retain valuable clients and sustain growth.

Purpose
In a B2B context, losing a customer can have a significant impact. Our project aims to predict customer churn with high accuracy, allowing companies to identify at-risk clients and implement retention strategies before it's too late. This predictive power can transform how businesses approach customer relationship management and retention.

Key Features
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model: Leveraging SVM, the project provides robust predictions about customer churn.
SMOTE Sampling: By using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), we address class imbalance, enhancing the model's performance and reliability.
High Accuracy: Achieving a remarkable 99% accuracy, our model ensures dependable predictions.
Power BI Integration: Interactive dashboards in Power BI offer visual insights into churn predictions and customer data trends.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for data processing, model building, and evaluation.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and detailed exploration of the model and data.
Power BI: To create dynamic and insightful visualizations that help stakeholders understand and act on churn predictions.
